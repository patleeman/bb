 *
 * dnd-kit's default side effect hides the drag source by writing `opacity: 0`
 * directly onto its DOM node, then restores the value it captured at drop time
 * from `animation.onfinish`. Sidebar rows dim their drag source through a
 * React-owned inline opacity (below, and the section-thread ghost row in
 * `ProjectRow`), so that restore is a raw DOM write racing React: it only has
 * to land after the drop-settle window clears the ghost — main-thread work from
 * the move mutation is enough — and the dim value is re-applied permanently.
 * React's committed style no longer carries an opacity, so there is nothing
 * left for it to diff away and the row stays greyed out until it remounts.
 * With side effects off the source row's opacity stays owned by React alone,
 * and the dimmed row reads as the landing slot while the overlay animates onto
 * it.
